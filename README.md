# Pacman Game
  -> This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pacman game using the pygame library. 
  -> The game includes basic functionalities such as player movement, ghost movement, and rendering of the game board.

# Overview
- This project implements a basic version of the Pacman game using Python and the pygame library. The game features a player-controlled Pacman character that moves around the board, collecting dots and avoiding ghosts.

- The game is designed to be a simple yet fun way to explore game development concepts using pygame. The player can control Pacman using the arrow keys, navigating through the maze to collect all the dots while avoiding the ghosts. If Pacman is caught by a ghost, the game ends.

# Libraries Usedpygame: 
  -> Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries to create games and multimedia applications. Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.

# Code Structure
The code structure of this Pacman game includes the following main components:
- Imports and Initialization: The necessary libraries are imported, and the pygame module is initialized.
- Loading Images: The images for Pacman and the ghosts are loaded.
- Initial Game State: The initial positions, directions, and speeds of Pacman and the ghosts are set.
- Level Definition: A 2D list representing the game map is defined.
- Functions: Functions to handle various game aspects like drawing the game board.
- Main Game Loop: The main loop where the game runs, handling events, updating game state, drawing game elements, and refreshing the screen.

# How to Play
- Objective: The goal of the game is to collect all the dots on the board while avoiding the ghosts.
- Controls: Use the arrow keys to move Pacman.
